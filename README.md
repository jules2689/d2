# dev

A system utility tool to provide easy cloning, access, and management for projects. [Inspired by the `dev` tool at Shopify](https://devproductivity.io/dev-shopifys-all-purpose-development-tool/index.html).

WIP.

## How to Install?

1. Add `source /path/to/dev/exe/dev.sh` to your `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, etc.
2. Restart your terminal.
3. Run `dev help` to see what is available.
